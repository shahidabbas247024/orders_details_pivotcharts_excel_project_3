# Online Orders Details – Excel PivotCharts Dashboard (Project 3)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how Excel can be used with **MySQL Database**, **Power Query**, and **PivotCharts** to analyze and visualize online orders data.  

The goal was to design an interactive dashboard focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as product demand, profitability, revenue by country, and payment method usage.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Extract data from a **MySQL Database** using the **Get Data** function in Excel.  
- Perform **data transformation** with Power Query (data types, new columns, transformations).  
- Create multiple **PivotCharts** to answer critical business questions:
  - What are the most ordered products in each category?  
  - What are the most profitable products in each product category?  
  - Which were the **Top 10 Countries** with the most revenue?  
  - Which payment method was used most frequently?
